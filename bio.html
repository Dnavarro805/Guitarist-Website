			Daniel remembers his first impression of the classical guitar as being his initial calling to the instrument. Daniel would come to hear an arrangement of the song “Michelle” by the Beatles for solo classical guitar on a local television’s arts channel. He vividly remembers being instantly captivated by the instrument’s poetic quality of sound and tonal colors.

		<P>
			Daniel later inevitably found the masters such as Paco de Lucia and Andres Segovia, musicians that would leave such an impression on him that he knew from then on, there was no going back.
